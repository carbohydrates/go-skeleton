Starter Project for Web-based Go projects
===============

I was an early-adopter of Go. After 5+ years of developing with Go, I have come up with this as an effective initial project structure. Many of my own real-world production projects are based on this structure. It is also great for "Hello World" learner projects.

It is heavily influenced by the PHP framework [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel).

Feel free to use it. The Licence is [WTFPL - Version 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL)
